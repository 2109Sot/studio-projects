        Comparing incidents before and after the first Memorandum.

      <p>“Forbearance and conscientiousness, combined with the excessive heat, and the lack of all the necessary means of personal protection, led our to our colleague’s death, instead of life, because she was struggling to collect garbage,” said Nikos Trakas, President of the municipality workers union POE-OTA, in an interview confirming the death by heart attack of Daniela Preloretzou, a 62-year-old female sanitation worker, on Friday, June 30, during her second shift in less that 24 hours under a phenomenal heatwave in Athens. Two days later, on Sunday, July 2, a 45-year-old male sanitation worker got injured at work in Thessaloniki and then admitted to the intensive care unit of a local hospital.</p>

      <p>The two incidents briefly catapulted the question of accidents in the Greek workplace and my assumption that their figures have skyrocketed in recent years due the economic crisis. Using records from the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT) in .csv format, I started gathering preliminary information about accidents in the Greek workplace from 2005 — three years before the global economic crisis began and five years before Greece signed the first Referendum with its European creditors — until 2015, when ELSTAT’s reference period ends. Well, it didn’t take long before I realized that my initial assumption was rather naive.</p><br />
