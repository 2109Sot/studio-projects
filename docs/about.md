I am the co-founder and managing editor of [AthensLive](http://athenslive.gr/), the first non-profit media outlet in Greece. I also work as a video producer for [FOS PHOTOS](http://www.fosphotos.com/), a recently founded Greek photo and video agency. Prior to that, I worked as a freelance copywriter for the tech start-up [Grip](https://grip.events/), and an intern for the [Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation](http://www.ert.gr/) and [To Vima](http://www.tovima.gr/).

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Communication & Media Studies from the Panteion University
of Athens and a Master’s degree in New Media & Digital Culture from the University of
Amsterdam.

This summer I added to my journalism skillset through a 12-week immersion program in data journalism and coding at Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.
