      <p>Milan is the mecca for all things chic and fabulous. Aspiring musicians flock to Bristol. Copenhagen is the place-to-be for designers. Yet what about other cities in Europe? What is the creative fabric of Edinburgh? Where do comic book writers cluster?</p>

      <p>In this article we are not using census and jobs data to map creative communities. Instead, we are following a different approach: we are using <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com">Kickstarter</a> data, which is one of the largest archives of creative projects, ever. Thanks to <a href="https://webrobots.io/kickstarter-datasets/">Web Robots,</a> we got access to more than 15,000 Kickstarter projects that took place in Europe from Januray 2016 to July 2017, the latter being the time of writing this article. This way we can characterize every major city by the types of projects it launches.</p>

      <p><b>First, let’s start with how each country in our dataset compares to the other.</b></p>

      </div>

      <p><b>What makes the UK unique?</b> First, as we can see in the heat map above most of the Kickstarter action takes place there with 17,507 projects. Second, we broke down Kickstarter into 15 categories (e.g., games, fashion, film) and interestingly enough 'technology' is not the most popular category there. Keep that in mind as you're scrolling down. Now, in case you're wondering why Greece or Portugal, for instance, didn't make it into our analysis, that's simply because Kickstarter is not available <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq/creator+questions?ref=faq_subcategory#GettStar">there.</a></p>

      <p>But let’s go deeper on the <b>50 most popular cities</b> of our sample. This will help us understand why the UK is so unique. Just take a look at the size of the circle that represents London. Also, the fact that Manchester or Edinburg, cities with much smaller populations compared to Berlin, have more projects than the latter, which is one of the most vibrant creative communities worldwide, didn't come with no surprise to us.</p><br />

     <div>
       <img width="60%" src="https://2109sot.github.io/studio-projects/kickstarter/euro_map.svg" alt="" />
     </div>

      <p>While a breakdown of film vs. music projects is helpful, what is the nature of these projects? Were they large (in number of backers)? Or were they small and localized to the city’s community?</p>

      <p>Every Kickstarter project is depicted as a small circle, sized by its number of backers, <b>having at least one backer.</b> Circles colored in light grey represent projects under less popular categories in each city.</p><br /><br />

     <div>
       <img width="50%" src="https://2109sot.github.io/studio-projects/kickstarter/all_bubbles_TITLE-02.svg" alt="" />
     </div><br /><br /><br />

     </div>

    <p>These bubble charts give us a powerful sense of a city’s creative center of gravity. Eidhoven is 51.3% technology projects (green in color). Among 50 cities, it has the most concentrated number of projects in one category: technology. At the same time, Edinburgh is represented by 40% theater projects, depicted by orange dots.</p>

    <p>Other interesting observations:</p>

    <p><b>The Netherlands and fashion:</b> we were surprised by the number of fashion projects in Amsterdam and Rotterdam. Technology and games, though, is where the money go in those two cities respectively.</p>

      <b>Notes on methodology</b>: According to Wikipedia, in 1993 there was roughly 500 complementary currency systems, and by 2003 there was over 4,000. My dataset, however, created by scraping complementarycurrency.org, includes 296 registered and operating systems worldwide, while this article takes into account the 10 countries with the most systems registered.
