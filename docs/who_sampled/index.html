        BREAKING DOWN THE WORLD'S MOST SAMPLED DRUM LOOP

        YOU ARE WRONG IF YOU THINK THAT HIP-HOP ARTISTS HAVE USED IT THE MOST
      </div>

      <p>We all know what a musical sample is, right? But do we all know which is the most popular
        music sample of all times? As you play the clip below, you can get answers for both questions and stop reading this post.</p>

      <p><iframe width="600" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5SaFTm2bcac" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

      <p>In case you slept on the video above, one of the most fascinating interpretations of subcultures,
        the ownership of culture, the nature of art and creativity, here's what we will be talking about in the rest of this post.</p>

        YOU HAVE HEARD IT DOZENS OF TIMES BEFORE
      </div>

      <p>The "Amen Break," a six-second drum sample from 1969 by <a href="https://www.discogs.com/The-Winstons-Color-Him-Father-Amen-Brother/release/423956">the Winstons,</a>
        is a ubiquitous piece of the pop culture soundscape. It has been used as a rhythmic backdrop in everything from late 1980s
        gangsta rap to corporate America's recycling hip-hop forms to sell cars and fashion items. It's probably the track for which the Winstons are best known. However, it is the b-side
        "Amen Brother," that has that classic drum break down right in the middle of the song which makes it perfect for sampling.</p>

      <p>With the advent of the sampler in the 1980s the "Amen Break" came back to the forefront. The sampler is a beatiful apparatus, about the size of a VCR, that
      allows its user to record any sound into it for quick playback and rearrangement. The sampler as well as the turntable were principal tools largely responsible for the birth, development and dissemination of hip-hop.
      Nowadays, almost all commercially produced music has been, at least in part, realised with the sampler. Fans know that when a new Beyoncé, Kanye or Diplo track drops, it will likely contain a musical sample of yesteryear.
      But hip-hop and other electronic-based music genres pioneered the creative use of samplers and the "Amen Break" was one of the first drum samples to be experimented with.

     <p>Here is an early example, the track "Straight Outta Compton" by N.W.A. realeased in 1989.</p>

     <p><iframe width="600" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TMZi25Pq3T8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

     <p>According to THE measure, the wiki-style database <a href="http://www.whosampled.com/The-Winstons/Amen,-Brother/sampled/">whosampled.com</a> whose users obsessively track samples, the "Amen Break" has been sampled more than 2,500 times
       and "Straight Outta Compton" is the most popular song in which the sample appears. In the UK right around the time "Straight Outta Compton" is released, the rave scene there explodes with musicians and DJs using samplers and the "Amen Break" to produce hardcore techno, ragga, jungle, and drum and base.
       Jungle music, in particular, an amalgamation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deejay_(Jamaican)">reggae toasting,</a> heavy baselines and high-speed break beats, centers its aesthetic almost entirely around the diconstruction of the "Amen."</p>

    <p>Here is a jungle music example, the track "Original Nuttah" by Shy-FX released in 1994.</p>

      LET THE NUMBERS TALK
    </div>

    <p>Having all that said, here is what I decided to do. I decided scrape all the 167 pages
    of the "Amen Break's" whosampled.com entry in order to compare hip-hop and electronic music tracks in which the sample appears.
    That way hip-hop artists, such as Eric B. and Rakim, could be compared to electronic music artists, such as Squarerpusher.</p>

    <div>
      <img width="95%" src="https://2109sot.github.io/studio-projects/who_sampled/who_sampled_graph_ZOOM-02.png" alt="" />
    </div><br />

    <p>2658 songs, 1367 artists, 9 genres since 1986. That was my dataset. Of the 45 artists in the graph above, let’s take a look at who is on top.</p>

    <div id="my_left_aligned_subheader">
      #1 - N.W.A. or Technical Itch?
    </div>

    <p>Counting how many times the sample has been used, Technical Itch, the British drum and bass artist known for his dark and intense hard style beats and founder of <a href="https://techitch.com/">Tech Itch Recordings</a> and its child Penetration Records is undoubtedly the champion of "Amen Break" sample having used it 45 times.
      On the other hand, counting how popular a song in which the sample appears, N.W.A. reached the top with just one song. It is important to mention here that no hip-hop artist in my dataset has used the sample more than two times. However, most of them appear higher than electronic music artists do in the popularity rankings of whosampled.com
      The graph below reveals such an antithesis in numbers.</p><br />

    </div><br />

    <div id="my_left_aligned_subheader">
      #2 - Luke Vibert
    </div>

    <p><a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/253-Luke-Vibert">Luke Francis Vibert</a> is a prolific British electronic music composer. Initially he was positioned somewhere in the middle of my graph. However, summing up all the times he has used the sample <b>under his many aliases</b>, I managed to distinguish all his different entries in my dataset and move him left to the second position.</p>

    <div id="my_left_aligned_subheader">
      #3 - Venetian Snares
    </div>

    <p>Canadian producer of vastly varying types of electronic music, gained a profile in experimental techno circles with his signing to the <a href="http://planet.mu/">Planet Mu</a> label.</p>

    <div id="my_left_aligned_subheader">
      #10 - Nebula
    </div>

    <p>Nebula has used the sample 18 times. He has produced 19 tracks in total. Who knows what he was going through that one time.</p>

    <div id="my_left_aligned_subheader">
      #13 - Enduser
    </div>

    <p>In his album <a href="https://end-user.bandcamp.com/album/comparing-paths">Comparing Paths</a> Enduser has used the sample in 9 songs. The album consists of 13 songs.</p>

    <div id="my_left_aligned_subheader">
      Mantronix
    </div>

    <p>"With Mantronix's 1988 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_BxXeqvzvE">Kings of the Beats,</a> rhythm becomes thermodynamic; intensities and pressures, drops and rises, stalls and stutters, peaks and plateaus. King of the Beats imposes a state of inertia from the start. Beats drag, press down on the shoulders, tug at the armpits, then seep across the back as sirens loop into high frequency swarms. Editor Chip Nunez microsplices tape of The Winstons' Amen Brother break into a polyrhythmic arrangement of looped loops. The effect oscillates between the impedimental and the impellant, veers from drumstates of anticipatory inhibition to pent-up propulsion and back again." ~ <i>Kodwo Eshun, 1998</i></p>

    <div id="my_another_subheader">
      HONORABLE MENTIONS
    </div>

    <p>Finally, here is a top-5 list of tracks-artists that did not make it to my hip-hop VS electronic music graph, but deserve to be mentioned for the sake of the "Amen Break"</p>
