        YOU ARE WRONG IF YOU THINK THAT HIP-HOP ARTISTS HAVE USED IT THE MOST
      </div>

      <p>We all know what a musical sample is, right? But do we all know which is the most popular
        music sample of all times? As you play the clip below, you can get answers for both questions and stop reading this post.</p>

      <p>In case you slept on the video above, one of the most fascinating interpretations of subcultures,
        the ownership of culture, the nature of art and creativity, here's what we will be talking about in the rest of this post.</p>

        YOU HAVE HEARD IT DOZENS OF TIMES BEFORE
      </div>

      <p>The "Amen Break," a six-second drum sample from 1969 by <a href="https://www.discogs.com/The-Winstons-Color-Him-Father-Amen-Brother/release/423956">the Winstons,</a>
        is a ubiquitous piece of the pop culture soundscape. It has been used as a rhythmic backdrop in everything from late 1980s
        gangsta rap to corporate America's recycling hip-hop forms to sell cars and fashion items. It's probably the track for which the Winstons are best known. However, it is the b-side
        "Amen Brother," that has that classic drum break down right in the middle of the song which makes it perfect for sampling.</p>

      <p>With the advent of the sampler in the 1980s the "Amen Break" came back to the forefront. The sampler is a beatiful apparatus, about the size of a VCR, that
      allows its user to record any sound into it for quick playback and rearrangement. The sampler as well as the turntable were principal tools largely responsible for the birth, development and dissemination of hip-hop.
      Nowadays, almost all commercially produced music has been, at least in part, realised with the sampler. Fans know that when a new Beyoncé, Kanye or Diplo track drops, it will likely contain a musical sample of yesteryear.
      But hip-hop and other electronic-based music genres pioneered the creative use of samplers and the "Amen Break" was one of the first drum samples to be experimented with.

     <p>Here is an early example, the track "Straight Outta Compton" by N.W.A. realeased in 1989.</p>

     <p><iframe width="600" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TMZi25Pq3T8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

     <p>According to THE measure, the wiki <a href="http://www.whosampled.com/The-Winstons/Amen,-Brother/sampled/">whosampled.com</a> whose users obsessively track samples, the "Amen Break" has been sampled more than 2,500 times
       and "Straight Outta Compton" is the most popular song in which the sample appears. In the UK right around the time "Straight Outta Compton" is released, the rave scene there explodes with musicians and DJs using samplers and the "Amen Break" to produce hardcore techno, ragga, jungle, and drum and base.
       Jungle music, in particular, an amalgamation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deejay_(Jamaican)">reggae toasting,</a> heavy baselines and high-speed break beats, centers its aesthetic almost entirely around the diconstruction of the "Amen."</p>

    <p>Here is a jungle music example, the track "Original Nuttah" by Shy-FX released in 1994.</p>
