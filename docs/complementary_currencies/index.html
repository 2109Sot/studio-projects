        IT'S NOT (ONLY) A $$$ THING

      <p>Well, this is not a what-to-do-when-there's-more-month-than-money-type article. Neither an attempt to list the top 10 destinations in the world where money is not in charge.
      Accordingly, this is not the idea behind a complementary currency system either, that is to replace 'established' national currencies. On the contrary, as its name suggests, a complementary currency can be thought of as supplementing or complementing national currencies. Thank you captain obvious!</p>

      <p>Pretty much most complementary currencies have multiple purposes and are intended to address multiple issues. They can be useful for communities that do not have access to financial capital, and for adjusting peoples' spending behavior.
      While complementary currencies have been around for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_historical_currencies">ages,</a> this post, using data from <a href="http://complementarycurrency.org/ccDatabase/les_public.html">complementarycurrency.org</a> focuses on a more 'contemporary' version of such exchange systems.
      </p>

      <div id="my_footer">
        <b>Notes on methodology</b>: According to Wikipedia, in 1993 there was roughly 500 complementary currency systems, and by 2003 there was over 4000. My dataset, however, created by scraping complementarycurrency.org, includes 296 registered and operating systems worldwide, while this article takes into account the top 10 countries with the most systems.
      </div>

      <p> As we can see in the chart above, since the 1980s there has been an increase in the number of complementary currencies, <a href="http://www.lets.victoria.bc.ca/">Victoria Local Exchange Trading System</a> in Canada being the first created in 1982, followed by <a href="http://www.sterrenstelsel.nl/php/index.php?PAGINA=0">LETS Utrecht e.o., het Sterrenstelsel</a> in the Netherlands in 1985 and <a href="http://www.magicalmaleny.com/page/50868/">Maleny LETS</a> in Australia in 1987.</p>

      <p>When speaking about complementary currencies, a number of overlapping and often interchangeable terms are in use: local or community currencies are complementary currencies used within a locality or other form of community (such as business-based or online communities); regional currencies are similar to local currencies but used within a larger geographical region; and sectoral currencies are complementary currencies used within a single economic sector, such as education or health care. The table below shows the most common types of complementary currencies in the 10 countries of my dataset with the most systems registered.</p>

     <p>Here is an early example, the track "Straight Outta Compton" by N.W.A. realeased in 1989.</p>

     <p><iframe width="600" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TMZi25Pq3T8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

     <p>According to THE measure, the wiki-style database <a href="http://www.whosampled.com/The-Winstons/Amen,-Brother/sampled/">whosampled.com</a> whose users obsessively track samples, the "Amen Break" has been sampled more than 2,500 times
       and "Straight Outta Compton" is the most popular song in which the sample appears. In the UK right around the time "Straight Outta Compton" is released, the rave scene there explodes with musicians and DJs using samplers and the "Amen Break" to produce hardcore techno, ragga, jungle, and drum and base.
       Jungle music, in particular, an amalgamation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deejay_(Jamaican)">reggae toasting,</a> heavy baselines and high-speed break beats, centers its aesthetic almost entirely around the diconstruction of the "Amen."</p>

    <p>Here is a jungle music example, the track "Original Nuttah" by Shy-FX released in 1994.</p>

      LET THE NUMBERS TALK
    </div>

    <p>Having all that said, here is what I decided to do. I decided scrape all the 167 pages
    of the "Amen Break's" whosampled.com entry in order to compare hip-hop and electronic music tracks in which the sample appears.
    That way hip-hop artists, such as Eric B. and Rakim, could be compared to electronic music artists, such as Squarerpusher.</p>

    <div>
      <img width="95%" src="https://2109sot.github.io/studio-projects/who_sampled/who_sampled_graph_ZOOM-02.png" alt="" />
    </div><br />

    <p>2658 songs, 1367 artists, 9 genres since 1986. That was my dataset. Of the 45 artists in the graph above, let’s take a look at who is on top.</p>

    <div id="my_left_aligned_subheader">
      #1 - N.W.A. or Technical Itch?
    </div>

    <p>Counting how many times the sample has been used, Technical Itch, the British drum and bass artist known for his dark and intense hard style beats and founder of <a href="https://techitch.com/">Tech Itch Recordings</a> and its child Penetration Records is undoubtedly the champion of "Amen Break" sample having used it 45 times.
      On the other hand, counting how popular a song in which the sample appears, N.W.A. reached the top with just one song. It is important to mention here that no hip-hop artist in my dataset has used the sample more than two times. However, most of them appear higher than electronic music artists do in the popularity rankings of whosampled.com
      The graph below reveals such an antithesis in numbers.</p><br />

    </div><br />

    <div id="my_left_aligned_subheader">
      #2 - Luke Vibert
    </div>

    <p><a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/253-Luke-Vibert">Luke Francis Vibert</a> is a prolific British electronic music composer. Initially he was positioned somewhere in the middle of my graph. However, summing up all the times he has used the sample <b>under his many aliases</b>, I managed to distinguish all his different entries in my dataset and move him left to the second position.</p>

    <div id="my_left_aligned_subheader">
      #3 - Venetian Snares
    </div>

    <p>Canadian producer of vastly varying types of electronic music, gained a profile in experimental techno circles with his signing to the <a href="http://planet.mu/">Planet Mu</a> label.</p>

    <div id="my_left_aligned_subheader">
      #10 - Nebula
    </div>

    <p>Nebula has used the sample 18 times. He has produced 19 tracks in total. Who knows what he was going through that one time.</p>

    <div id="my_left_aligned_subheader">
      #13 - Enduser
    </div>

    <p>In his album <a href="https://end-user.bandcamp.com/album/comparing-paths">Comparing Paths</a> Enduser has used the sample in 9 songs. The album consists of 13 songs.</p>

    <div id="my_left_aligned_subheader">
      Mantronix
    </div>

    <p>"With Mantronix's 1988 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_BxXeqvzvE">Kings of the Beats,</a> rhythm becomes thermodynamic; intensities and pressures, drops and rises, stalls and stutters, peaks and plateaus. King of the Beats imposes a state of inertia from the start. Beats drag, press down on the shoulders, tug at the armpits, then seep across the back as sirens loop into high frequency swarms. Editor Chip Nunez microsplices tape of The Winstons' Amen Brother break into a polyrhythmic arrangement of looped loops. The effect oscillates between the impedimental and the impellant, veers from drumstates of anticipatory inhibition to pent-up propulsion and back again." ~ <i>Kodwo Eshun, 1998</i></p>

    <div id="my_another_subheader">
      HONORABLE MENTIONS
    </div>

    <p>Finally, here is a top-5 list of tracks-artists that did not make it to my hip-hop VS electronic music graph, but deserve to be mentioned for the sake of the "Amen Break".</p>

      <b>Notes on methodology</b>: All entries are scraped from whosampled.com. Hip-hop artists in my main graph were selected by 'popularity' criteria, while the electronic music artists displayed have all used the "Amen Break" more than 10 times.</a>
