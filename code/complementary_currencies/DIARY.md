### DATABASE: http://complementarycurrency.org/ccDatabase/les_public.html

Started scraping the main page of the database, but the info I am mostly interested
are located on the individual page of each entry, so I am going for a second round of scraping soon. This way, I will be able to identify the lifespan of each entry, the country or city of origin as well as the community each system is serving, the currency used in each case, and the reason of a system's creation.

The website is really bad for scraping, so I decided to do some manual work. That ended up quite well as I managed to get the year of establishment for each entry, and not the year of registration to the database. Moreover, I added more columns to my dataset, such as the medium of transactions, source of funding, unit of value, organization type, and system type.
