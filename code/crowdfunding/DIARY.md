# CROWDFUNDING ART PROJECTS

----------------------

## 08/14

Got my data from https://webrobots.io.

I "concated" my data into two separate dataframes, one for Kickstarter and one for Indiegogo.

Unfortunately, Indiegogo does not contain as many columns as Kickstarter does, such location and backers_count. I tried to scrape Indiegogo with Selenium but I got kicked off really soon.

I cleaned my data and managed to identify successful and failed campaigns on both platforms, as well as how much money the successful ones have raised. $$$
